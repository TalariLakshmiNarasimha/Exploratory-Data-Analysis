# Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis** project!  
This repository is dedicated to performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various datasets, aiming to extract insights, visualize data distributions, and uncover hidden patterns that can guide further data modeling and decision-making.

## Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data science or machine learning project. This repository provides code and notebooks to:
- Load and clean datasets
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Detect outliers, anomalies, and missing values
- Summarize data with descriptive statistics

## Features

- üìä **Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation heatmaps, and more
- üßπ **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, data types, and outliers
- üìà **Statistical Summaries**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
- üîç **Customizable Analysis**: Easily adapt scripts/notebooks for new datasets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Common data science libraries

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TalariLakshmiNarasimha/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is not available, install: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter, etc.)*

### Running the Analysis

Open the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to start your EDA. You can launch Jupyter Notebook with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the desired notebook and follow the instructions within.
